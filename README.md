# DelaunayVoronoiApk_ENSG_project
Python Application with a graphic interface. From a set of point (2D) , draws the Delaunay triangulation of given set of points and the dual Voronoi diagram. 

Instructions 

Running the program is very simple. Simply open the Delaunay[...] folder and execute (double click) the 'ApplicationDelaunay.py' file in the same folder (do not separate the files in it).
A window opens:

- The button Load a file : 
by clicking on this button the Windows explorer will open automatically allowing the user to choose and load the file containing the points. The '.dta' or '.txt' file format
for the tests, the application is provided with 6 sets of points in the same folder. 

- The points in the chosen file should be as follows: X Y

- The Draw button 'Tracer Delaunay':
Allows to draw the Delaunay triangulation of the given set of points. You can also check the checkbutton 'see circles' if you want to see the triangulation and the associated circles.

- The button  'Afficher set de point'
Allows to display the cloud of data points. You can also, after having drawn the triangulation, press this button to see the points, the triangulation and even the circles on the same plot.

- The button 'Effacer le canevas'  
Allows you to clear the canvas for a possible new construction, i.e. you don't have to close the window to start all over again. 

- The button 'Enregistrer lâ€™image'
Allows you to save the image as a .png file. By clicking on this button a window will open where you can insert the name of the file to be saved. The image is saved in the same folder as the application.

- To quit: File > 'Quitter '
